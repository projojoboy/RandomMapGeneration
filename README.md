## Random Map Generator

In this project I made a system that generates a random top down map. I made this in Unity2D with C# language.

## Features
- Random Map Generation
- Easy to transfer to other projects

## Software Analysis 
For this project I was allowed to use any language I wanted to use, so I looked what was the best, because unity is made for game development and a random map generation is for games I decided to go for unity.

## Learning Goals 
- I want to learn how to make the a random map generation simple
- I want to learn how to make the a random map generation interresting and not repetitive
